# DEPRECATED

## Notice

ldkit has been deprecated in favor of [ldkit2](https://github.com/nddrylliog/ldkit2).

The rationale for that is mostly that SDL1/cairo/gobject/freetype2/openal/alut/vorbis/etc. are a pain to work with, whereas dye/bleep are much more lightweight.

## ldkit

ldkit was a basic survival kit for writing games in ooc. Started during Ludum Dare #23 :)
